      Originally founded in Germany in 1896 by the Carl Lindström Company as Parlophon, the British arm of the<br>
      label was formed in 1923 under the name Parlophone Records, which quickly developed an identity as a<br>
      leading jazz label. In 1926, Parlophone was acquired by the Columbia Phonograph Company which, a few<br>
      years later, merged with The Gramophone Company and became Electric and Musical Industries (EMI).<br>

      Beatles. With Cilla Black, Billy J. Kramer, The Fourmost and The Hollies also signed to the label,<br>

      their number one debut album in the UK, Parachutes, which went on to win a Grammy for Best Alternative<br>

      flourished throughout the decade as a stalwart of the British music scene.<br>
