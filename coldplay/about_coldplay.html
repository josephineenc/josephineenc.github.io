    Coldplay formed at the University College of <a href="london.html">London</a> in 1998 by guitarists Martin, a pianist from childhood and also a
    singer, and Jon Buckland; they were later joined by drummer Will Champion and bassist Guy Berryman. (Tim Rice-Oxley was
    asked to join on keyboards, but was too busy with his own group, Keane.) They played their first shows as "the 
    Coldplay," and in 1998 self-issued an EP, Safety. The following year, the group released the Brothers and Sisters EP on
    U.K. indie Fierce Panda, performed their first sessions for the BBC Radio 1 presenter Steve Lamacq, played Glastonbury,
    and signed to <a href="parlophone.html">Parlophone</a> in short order.
