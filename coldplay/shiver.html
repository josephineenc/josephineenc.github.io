		<p>So I look in your direction<br>
		But you pay me no attention, do you<br>
		I know you don't listen to me<br>
		'Cause you say you see straight through me, don't you<br>
		</p>
        
        <p>And on and on from the moment I wake<br>
		To the moment I sleep<br>
		I'll be there by your side<br>
		Just you try and stop me<br>
		I'll be waiting in line<br>
		Just to see if you can<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>Did she want me to change<br>
		Well I change for good<br>
		And I want you to know<br>
		But you always get your way<br>
		I wanted to say<br>
        </p>

 		<p>Don't you shiver, shiver, shiver</p>

		 <p>I'll always be waiting for you<br>
		So you know how much I need you<br>
		But you never even see me, do you<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>And is this is my final chance of getting you</p>

         <p>And on and on from the moment I wake<br>
		To the moment I sleep<br>
		I'll be there by your side<br>
		Just you try and stop me<br>
		I'll be waiting in line<br>
		Just to see if you care<br>
        </p>

		<p>And is this is my final chance of getting you</p>

        <p>Don't you shiver<br>
		Don't you shiver<br>
        </p>

		<p>Sing it loud and clear<br>
		I'll always be waiting for you<br>
		</p>

		<p>Yeah I'll always be waiting for you<br>
  		Yeah I'll always be waiting for you<br>
  		Yeah I'll always be waiting for you<br>
  		For you I will always be waiting<br>
  		</p>

		<p>And it's you I see, but you don't see me<br>
		And it's you I hear, so loud and clear<br>
		I sing it loud and clear<br>
		And I'll always be waiting for you<br>
        </p>
        
        <p>So I look in your direction<br>
		But you pay me no attention<br>
		And you know how much I need you<br>
		But you never even see me<br>
