          There’s nowhere quite like the City. Not only is it the oldest, most historic part of London,<br>
          it is the world’s leading international financial and business centre with the unusual ratio<br>
          of 33 times more workers than residents; it also has its own unique system of administration<br>
          and is not classified as a borough, but is a small district at the heart of the capital.<br>
          The short video above helps explain how history has made it this way.<br>
          </p>
          
          <p>
          Established in around AD50, seven years after the Romans invaded Britain, the City, or Square<br>
          Mile as it has become known, is the place from which modern-day London grew.<br>
          </p>
          
          <p>
          The remains of the City's Roman wall can be seen in various locations, the foundations of<br>
          the Roman Temple of Mithras have been unearthed here and London’s only Roman Amphitheatre<br>
          was discovered under Guildhall Art Gallery in 1988.<br>
          </p>
          
          <p>
          But it’s not just the Roman remains and medieval structures that make the City’s buildings<br>
          so unique; it is their juxtaposition with contemporary architecture designed to house the<br>
          global business giants that have located here. This is where ancient and modern sit side<br>
          by side.<br>
