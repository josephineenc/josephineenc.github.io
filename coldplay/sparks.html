<p>Did I drive you away
I know what you'll say
You say, "Oh, sing one you know"
But I promise you this
I'll always look out for you
Yeah that's what I'll do</p>

<p>I say, oh 
I say, oh</p>

<p>My heart is yours
It's you that I hold on to
Yeah that's what I do
And I know I was wrong
But I won't let you down
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I will, yes I will)</p>

<p>I say oh
I cry oh</p>

<p>Yeah I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks
And I saw sparks
Yeah I saw sparks</p>

<p>Sing it out</p>

<p>La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh
La, la, la, la, oh</p>
