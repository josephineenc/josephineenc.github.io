            HOW TO MAKE THIS RECIPE
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
            1. Combine soy sauce, sake, sugar, mirin, and 1 cup water in a medium saucepan and whisk until sugar is
            dissolved. Add king oyster mushrooms. Place a clean, lint-free paper towel or kitchen towel directly
            on the surface of the liquid, pressing down until it is completely saturated and keeps the mushrooms
            partially submerged. Bring to a simmer over high heat, then reduce to maintain a bare simmer. Cook
            until mushrooms are completely tender (a cake tester or paring knife inserted should meet little
            resistance as it goes through), about 30 minutes, flipping mushrooms once halfway through cooking.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
            2. Remove mushrooms from liquid and dry carefully with paper towels. Return remaining liquid to a gently boil
            over medium heat and cook until reduced to 1/2 cup, about 10 minutes. Set aside to cool. When mushrooms are
            cool enough to handle, slice each into 12 disks about 1/2-inch wide.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
            3. Heat oil in a large wok, saucepan, or deep fryer to 350°F and adjust flame to maintain temperature.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
            4. Combine cornstarch and flour in a large bowl and stir with chopsticks until roughly combined. Add soda and stir
            very rapidly with chopsticks while shaking bowl. Do not overmix—there should be plenty of lumps and bubbles. Add
            sliced mushrooms to bowl and turn to coat. Working one piece at a time, lift mushroom, allow excess batter to drip
            off, then slowly lower into hot oil. Repeat until all mushrooms are in the oil. Cook mushrooms, agitating oil
            and turning mushrooms occasionally with a wire mesh spider or long chopsticks until pale golden brown and 
            completely crisp, about 1 1/2 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and season with salt immediately.
            </p>
                <br>
            <p>
            5. Place steamed buns on a plate and cover with a damp paper towel. Microwave on high power until hot, about 1 minute.
            Spread miso mayonnaise in each steamed bun, then add shredded lettuce, two fried mushroom slices, a drizzle of the
            reduced simmering liquid, sliced scallions, and cilantro leaves. Close sandwiches and serve with extra miso mayonnaise
            on the side for dipping.
